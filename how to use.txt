this program really wasn't made with being easy to opperate in mind.
to install it you'll need to install the "node.js" runtime enviroment
for the server. from there you'll need to run a command something like
"node server.js" (no quotation marks) to run the server in the
"main_program" folder. note you will need to give the full file directory
of the server (something like C:\\users\documents\pointless\main_program\server.js rather than just sever.js)
from there you can probably follow the instructions that will pop up in
the console window. if you need a hand setting up the program feel free to 
try contacting me using the information in the "a-note-to-anyone-maintaining-this-program.txt"
file, or you could try asking one of the computer science teachers

once you have fully installed node.js you will need to go to a command prompt
(possiblly in administrater / sudo mode) and type the following one after
the other (no particular order)
npm install ip
npm install express
npm install socket.io
