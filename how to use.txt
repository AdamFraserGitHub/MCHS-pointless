this program was bashed together so really wasn't made with being easy to opperate in mind (sorry for that 😂).
to install it you'll need to install the "node.js" runtime enviroment
for the server. from there you'll need to run a command something like
"node server.js" (no quotation marks) to run the server in the
"main_program" folder. note you will need to give the full file directory
of the server (something like C:\\users\documents\pointless\main_program\server.js rather than just sever.js)
from there you can probably follow the instructions that will pop up in
the console window. if you need a hand setting up the program feel free to 
try contacting me using the information in the "a-note-to-anyone-maintaining-this-program.txt"
file, or you could try making a sacrafice to the almighty Cthulhu (it works for me)

once you have fully installed node.js you will need to go to a command prompt
(possiblly in administrater / sudo mode) and type the following one after
the other (no particular order)
npm install ip
npm install express
npm install socket.io

alternativly if you're on linux you can just run the setup.sh script to install the server and then
runServer.sh to run the server
to do this you will need to go to a command window in the directory containing setup.sh and type "sudo ./setup.sh"
if that doesn't work you will need to type "sudo chmod +x ./setup.sh". and then do the same for "runServer.sh"
