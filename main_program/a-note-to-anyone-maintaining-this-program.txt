ok this isn't my best work by any means but it gets the job done and it had to be done within a couple days. this project is an uncommented garbled mess with deadends, traps and boss fights. if you want me to go over the code or help 
you to add functionality / iron out bugs please feel free to contact me. i'll probably not have any of my old addresses or numbers so here's some information you can probably use to find me (unless i go full paranoid hermit)

a bunch of e-mails i won't have

to be able to edit this project you'll need a basic understanding of web languages, node.js, express.js, socket.io and a stress ball

i might add updates from time to time out of shame, if you want to update just pull the changes from github
