            <br>
            <p>this is a program for mearns castle's pointless spin off event 
            (it's really hard to use that word without sounding demeaning)
            there are 2 parts of the program you need to wory about; the <a href="/controlPannel">control pannel</a>
            and the <a href="scoreBoard">scoreboard</a>. on the control pannel you can enter how much you
            wish to increase each houses score by, submit changes, remove the
            lowest scoring team(s) and reset the game (clear scoreboard). the scoreboard
            displays the points of the houses that are still in the game. the user experience is downhill from here BTW</p>
